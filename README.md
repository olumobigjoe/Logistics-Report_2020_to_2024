## 📂 INTRODUCTION
---
<p align = "justify">A leading logistics company is currently facing challenges in maintaining delivery efficiency, ensuring customer satisfaction, and optimizing shipment performance across different transport modes and regions. Despite growing demand, the organization has observed inconsistencies in shipment completion rates, delays in high-priority deliveries, and varied levels of customer feedback, particularly tied to certain modes of transport such as Motorbikes and Lorries. Regional disparities in delivery times and shipment value have also raised concerns about route planning and carrier performance.
As a data analyst, you have been brought in to perform a comprehensive analysis of the company’s logistics data spanning from 2020 to 2024. Your task is to uncover insights that will help decision-makers understand the underlying causes of these issues and support data-driven improvements to the logistics operation.</p>
<p align = 'justify'> 
Structure your analysis around three key focus areas:

  - Track shipment volumes, identify trends in completed versus in-progress shipments, and assess delivery performance across time.
  - Break down expected shipment volumes by transport type (Jet, Bus, Lorry, Motorbike), priority level, and geographic distribution to reveal demand patterns and bottlenecks.
  - Evaluate customer satisfaction scores, payment status, shipment value, and delivery time to determine their influence on service quality perceptions.
